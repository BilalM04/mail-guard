# MailGuard

This repository contains the front-end application for classifying emails as spam or not using a machine learning model. The application is built using Node.js, React.js, and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the email classification API. You can explore the website yourself [here](https://bilalm04.github.io/mail-guard/).
